 * Remember the dangers of leaving your variables unitialized.
 * Always initialize your variables!
 *
 * Task:
 * 
 * 1) Declare an unitialized integer variable y and print its value.
 *      - What is its value? What happens if you re-run the program?
 *
 * 2) Intialize the variable correctly using braces. 
 *      - Is the value what you expect? Does it change if you rerun it?
 *
