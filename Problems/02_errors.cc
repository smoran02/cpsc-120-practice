/* 02_errors.cc
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * In this program, we're going to be experimenting with the 3 different 
 * categories of errors: compile-time, run-time, and logical.
 * 
 * First, can you write a program that causes a compile-time error?
 * Can you fix it? Does the program now compile and run as expected?
 * 
 * Change your program to cause a run-time error.
 * What is the difference between this and the compile-time error?
 * Now, fix the run-time error. Does your program behave as expected?
 *
 * Lastly, change your program to contain a logical error.
 * Can you think of any ways you might be able to prevent logical errors in
 * your code?
